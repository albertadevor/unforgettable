# Unforget*table*
### Final Project for Brown Unviersity's *Designing Humanity Centered Robots* (CS1951C)
### Created by Alberta Devor

Unforget*table* shows the overlap between two users location history data. It is intended to be used as part of a larger physical project in which two users standing at a table look at the projection of their overlapped location history on the tabletop. 

However, the site can be accessed in a slightly modified version at https://unforgettable.city/
